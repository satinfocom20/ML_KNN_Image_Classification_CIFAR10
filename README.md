# ML_KNN_Image_Classification_CIFAR10
CIFAR10 is a huge image dataset which can be downloaded from [HERE](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz)

The [CIFAR-10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks. "Automobile" includes sedans, SUVs, things of that sort. "Truck" includes only big trucks. Neither includes pickup trucks. Such a situation is called **multiclass** classification in oppose to **multilabel** classification when each example may have multiple label.

One can see state-of-the-art results [here](http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html)
